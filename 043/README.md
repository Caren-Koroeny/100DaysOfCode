# Day 43 of #100DaysOfCode
- Today I am proceeding with the python course I had started on py4e.com. I feel like my learning journey is a bit confusing. I want to complete learning python and do a project before I move to Javascript.
- Python is  a great language and it shouldn't really be giving me a hard time to learn it. I think I need to change my approach and learn systematically. I will now follow along py4e.com and complete my FCC projects as well.
- My main focus as at now is learning python and completing the FCC projects on my free time. That makes more sense to me. Let me give it my best and keep coding.

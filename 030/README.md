# Day 30 of #100DaysOfCode
Today I am reading about if/else statements, loops and functions in the python language.
## Resources that I have used
- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#id1) : Following through the explanations and writing the code to test it helped me to understand the concepts.
- [Youtube Video Series](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/ElQgZYNHrLI7kV_ysEB1hQ) : This tutorial series explains everything about Python programming. I am following along it. I like the hands-on exercises that it provides, they make me code actively!
